                    Textile waste generally isn’t considered to be a problem in waste management because even though the materials are made with a range of chemicals, the garments themselves aren’t considered to be toxic. But the truth is the clothing industry is considered to be the world's second largest polluter.

                    A massive amount of energy, water, and other resources are needed to make the clothes we see displayed in the storefront window. The issue is consumers have such a big disconnect when it comes to clothing. We don’t smell the pesticides used on the cotton, we don’t see the harmful dyes being poured down the drain, and we don’t see the sweatshop workers being abused or collapsing from exhaustion; we see a neatly folded sweater that would look perfect with that new pair of jeans.

                        Cotton is used to create over 40% of clothing, with the pressure put on farmers to create more cotton; cotton fields have turned into factories. To create more cotton pesticides are used, these toxins are known to cause illnesses such as cancer, birth defects, and mental health issues. But because clothing brands see GMO cotton as an effective way to produce mass quantities of cotton; these devastating effects are being ignored.

                        Globalised production means that the making of garments are outsourced to low-cost economies where wages are low. Those at the top of the value chain choose where their garments are made, if the current place of production can no longer make their clothing for cheap, they move their business elsewhere. As factory owners do not want to go out of business they are forced to neglect the safety of their workers,  pay them less, and make them work longer and harder; just so that we can get that cheap pair of jeans.

                        The Bangladesh disaster is a horrific and terrifying example of what happens when factories are forced to ignore the safety of their sweatshop workers. Women and men were beaten and forced to enter the deteriorating Ranza Plaza factory before it collapsed; killing a confirmed 1,137 people.
